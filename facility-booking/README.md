# MMU Facility Booking System

A static (for now) web application for booking MMU sports facilities with user and admin dashboards, booking forms, login/sign-up pages, and detailed facility info pages.

## Features
- User registration and login  
- Facility browsing with detailed info pages  
- Booking forms with confirmation page  
- Responsive design for all devices  

## How to Use
- Visit the homepage to browse facilities  
- Register and log in to book a facility  
- Admins can log in to manage bookings  

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:  
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open the `public/index.html` file in your preferred web browser  
3. Navigate through the site using the menus and links  

*Note: Since this is a static website, booking functionality and user authentication are currently non-functional placeholders.*

## Future Plans
This project is part of our team’s minor project at MMU. In the final year project, we plan to:  
- Implement backend functionality with a database for real bookings and user management  
- Add interactivity and real-time data handling  
- Improve security and authentication
